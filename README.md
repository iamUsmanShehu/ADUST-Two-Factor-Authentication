# ADUSTECH-Two-Factor-Authentication
ðŸš€ Exciting Update: Enhanced Security for Our School Portal at Aliko Dangote University of Science and Technology, Wudil (ADUSTECH) ðŸš€

I'm thrilled to announce a significant improvement to our school portal aimed at ensuring the security and integrity of student accounts. Previously, our portal allowed students to log in using their registration number and password, providing access to essential activities such as course registration (adding and dropping courses), school fees payment, and more.

However, I identified a potential security concern: unauthorized access could lead to misuse of a student's account, as experienced by one of our students. This incident highlighted the need for enhanced security measures.

To address this, I've implemented Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) for our school portal at ADUSTECH! ðŸŽ‰

Hereâ€™s how it works:

After entering their registration number and password, students will receive a One-Time Password (OTP) sent to their registered school phone number.
Only upon entering this OTP correctly will students be granted access to their dashboard.

This additional layer of security ensures that only the account owner can access their account, even if someone else knows their login credentials. I'm confident this enhancement will protect our students and their academic activities more effectively.

Looking forward to seeing the positive impact of this upgrade! ðŸ˜Š
